        &hellip; we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising revenues across the
        media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven&#8217;t put up a paywall &ndash; we want to
        keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian&#8217;s independent,
        investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our
        perspective matters &ndash; because it might well be your perspective, too.
      </p>
      <p class="contributions__paragraph contributions__paragraph--epic">
        The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not
        influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our Editor. No one steers our opinion.
        This is important because it enables us to give a voice to the voiceless, challenge the powerful and hold them to
        account. It&#8217;s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting
        is critical.
      </p>
      <p class="contributions__paragraph contributions__paragraph--epic">
        If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure.
